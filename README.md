# ManageIT (Demo Version)

A mock IT budgeting & contract management platform inspired by an enterprise workflow optimization project.

⸻

## Overview

ManageIT is a demo application designed to showcase my experience building internal IT tools that streamline budgeting, vendor management, and contract workflows.

The real version supported IT leadership, managers, Finance, and InfoSec by integrating budgeting data, automated approval flows, contract tracking, and vendor relationships into a single system.

This repo demonstrates the architecture, logic, and workflows behind the system using mock data and a simplified implementation.
